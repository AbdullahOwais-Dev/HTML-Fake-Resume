# 🔦 Torchlight Resume - Dark Mode with a Twist

Welcome to the **Torchlight Resume**, a unique, interactive HTML resume with a built-in custom *torch effect*! 😎 This is not your average CV – it's a fun experiment that blends creativity with web dev skills.

## ✨ Features

  - The mouse cursor acts as a torch, revealing text as you move it.
  - Makes reading in the dark a cool, immersive experience!
- ☀️ **Light Mode Support**:
  - Text is clearly readable without any torch needed.
  - Simple and clean design for those who prefer classic vibes.
- 🎨 **Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — No frameworks used!
- 💻 Fully Responsive and Lightweight

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Detects Theme Mode** (Dark or Light)
2. In **Dark Mode**, a `radial-gradient` follows your cursor, simulating a torchlight.
3. In **Light Mode**, the layout appears like a normal resume.
4. Toggle themes easily (optional if you added a toggle).
